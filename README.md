# I-can-has-plant-

## Basic idea
Take pic of plant, upload it and find it if you you can eat a plant or whether it's toxic.

Becode JS exercise to create a start-up using an open API

## Implementation
- upload image to api to identify plant
- use plant id to call second api to get toxicity/palatability (2 calls needed)
- return results
- no scrolling display

## To do's
- have users take pic and upload it to own server instead of third-party. Would greatly improve usability
- add styling
- testing scenario's (catching mismatches 2 api's, adapting result messages ...)
- clean up code/write comments in English
